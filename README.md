# AcceptBit.com

This is the source code deployed at AcceptBit.com, the easiest, most
secure merchant service for web and local transactions.

AcceptBit uses Electrum technology to separate public and private keys
and accept payments that cannot be spent by the same systems accepting
the payments.

AcceptBit also uses BitcoinJS technology to keep the payments status
updated in real-time so you can move on to the next customer.
